# Metis_project
Data science project for metis course

Background: The cells within our bodies contain proteins that are embedded in the cell surfaces.  Glycans are attached to these proteins in nearly all our cells.  Changes in the glycan's structure or abundance/scarcity have been known to be indicators of cancer progression.  As a result, there has been recent investigation into developing drugs that target glycans on the proteins of cancer cells.  

What is the question you hope to answer?

I hope to evaluate a dataset of biological molecules of cancer samples.  Within the dataset, I plan to identify which molecules are "overexpressed" (more prominent) in cancer cells vs. healthy cells.  The uniqueness in this project is that I will be focusing on glycoproteins, which have not yet been extensively studied as cancer biomarkers.  


What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

I am using the Unipep database (http://www.unipep.org/)


What do you know about the data you're using so far?


The data contains protein amino acid sequences, locations of amino acid sequence where a glycan is attached, and the mass of the peptide that is attached to the glycan.  


Why did you choose this topic?

I'd like to produce something that is beneficial for the cancer research community.
